# Python 3 course

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises proposed by the Python 3 course from the YouTube channel Curso em VÃ­deo. The course is divided in five modules, called worlds. Each module has a different number of exercises. Each script contains the solution to only one exercise, indicated by the file name. The file named 'ex000.py' is the script of the introduction lecture that shows the first commands.

## World one

## World two

## World three

## World four

## World five
