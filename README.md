# Python 3 course

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises proposed by the Python 3 course from the YouTube channel Curso em VÃ­deo. The course is divided in five modules called worlds. Each module has a different number of exercises. Each script in this repository contains the solution to only one exercise, indicated by the file name. The file named 'ex000.py' is the script of the introduction lecture that shows the first commands and the solutions to three simple challenges.

## World one
- First steps: first commands (ex000), exercises 1 and 2.

- Conditional statementes (if...else): exercises 28 through 35.
